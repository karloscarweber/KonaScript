This project stems first from working through the book: Crafting Interpreters, and then into building our own language on top of Lua. to start we'll implement Lox in Lua, then C, then build our language. I'm hoping that this will give enough context to understand how to do the language thing.


# Lox
grammer at: [lox.grammer.md](lox.grammer.md). Simple for now.
